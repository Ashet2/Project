Project Title: "Analyzing Immigration Trends in Canada: Data Cleaning and Visualization"

Project Overview:
In this project, I worked with a dataset downloaded from Statistics Canada's website. The dataset contained over 4.5 million records
of metadata and immigration data, which required significant preprocessing before it could be used for analysis. Using Python, 
I cleaned the data, extracted relevant information, and visualized key insights using popular data manipulation and visualization libraries.

Problem Statement:
The dataset from Statistics Canada was extensive and contained metadata and columns that required preprocessing and 
cleaning before meaningful analysis
could be conducted.

Solution:

Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Utilized Python's Pandas library to clean and preprocess the dataset.
Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Extracted and broke down the metadata to make it suitable for analysis.
Step 2: Data Visualization

Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to create informative visualizations.
Visualized the total immigrant population by place of birth (continent) and their destinations (Province) in Canada.
Produced summary tables and visuals for easy understanding.
Project Deliverables:

Link to Data Cleaning Code
Video clip with summary tables and visuals (provide link or shareable format)
Upcoming: Analysis of the cleaned data and its implications.
Skills Demonstrated:

Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Extracting insights from large datasets.
Communication of insights through visuals and summaries.
Outcome:
The project successfully transformed a complex and extensive dataset into a clean and analyzable format. 
The insights gained from this data analysis can be invaluable for various stakeholders, including potential immigrants 
looking for settlement information and businesses seeking to identify their target audience in terms of continental or local preferences.
